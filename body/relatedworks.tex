    \label{tab:competitor-analysis}
\end{table}

There are several parking availability provider systems on the market, each offering unique features and technologies, as shown in Table 2.1. The following three systems represent the most significant competitors to KU Parking:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{\textit{ParkMobile}}---a mobile app that allows users to find, reserve, and pay for parking through their smartphones.
    \item \textbf{\textit{SpotHero}}---a digital parking reservation service that allows drivers to locate and book parking spaces in garages and lots.
    \item \textbf{\textit{Parking Guidance System}}---a system that uses digital displays and indicator lights to show parking availability, with vacant spots detected through sensors
\end{itemize}
KU Parking focuses on providing information about parking facilities on the university campus, helping unfamiliar visitors navigate to available parking areas. The system aims to collect data on available spaces using surveillance cameras and an image processing model, delivering the information to users via a mobile application.
