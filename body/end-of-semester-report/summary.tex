\section{Overview Progress}
\label{section:overview-progress}
This semester, our team has focused on data collection and the development of the Car Detection Model. During the data collection phase, we encountered a challenge: the Computer Engineering parking area had a limited number of parked cars due to the semester break of other programs. To address this issue and ensure dataset diversity, we supplemented our dataset with online surveillance footage. Although our model performs reasonably well on test footage from the Computer Department parking area, it still struggles with wide-angle camera views and vehicles in unusual colors. Additional training will be required to improve the model’s reliability under various conditions.

We believe we are currently on schedule; however, the upcoming Cooperative Internship may slow our development pace. With this in mind, we plan to prioritize improvements to the Car Detection Model, which may take longer than the originally proposed timeline. As a result, the integration of the Parking Detection Model may be postponed—or potentially canceled—if progress on the Car Detection Model is insufficient. Overall, while there are still concerns regarding the Car Detection Model, the development progress remains on schedule.
