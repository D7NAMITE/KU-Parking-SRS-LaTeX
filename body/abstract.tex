Finding an optimal parking spot that is vacant within walking distance of the destination can be time-consuming in high-traffic areas with multiple parking areas such as university campuses or government complexes.
These common inconveniences affect drivers entering the area, especially visitors or non-residents, and often lead to wasted time and aimless searching between parking areas. The motivation for this project is to develope a system that can indicate to the user the availability of multiple parking areas while reducing the potential cost of deploying the system, which the traditional parking management might exceed the budget. 
KU Parking addresses this by utilizing existing infrastructure—surveillance cameras already installed in parking areas for security purposes—integrated with an image processing model to detect vacant parking spaces.
Users can check for availability in all parking areas near the destination before arriving.
The project is designed to deploy on the cloud to enhance installability. 
The effectiveness of the project can be evaluated based on the model's accuracy and user feedback.
The goal is to provide accurate data that minimizes inconvenience and reduces the time required to find a parking spot.
